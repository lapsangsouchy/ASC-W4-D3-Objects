# week3.day2.objects

## Instructions
1. Fork and clone this repo: [week3.day2.objects](https://github.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week3.day2.objects)
2. Follow the instructions in each `.js` file (located in `lib/js`)
   - There are three parts that will come together to make this website
     1. `heroes.js` - Responsible for creating the raw data
     2. `methods.js` - Responsible for creating instructions (methods) that will be used to create HTML elements from the data
     3. `events.js` - Responsible for creating the HTML and CSS, as well as assigning event handlers
3. At the start, I would highly recommend getting some data to flow from `heroes.js` to
`methods.js` to `events.js`. 
   - Try using some "dummy data" in `heroes.js`
   - Try getting just the `img` added to the first div in `methods.js`
   - Try to get hero images to show up in the `#gridDiv` in `events.js`
